## Reporting Vulnerabilities

WSO2 takes security issues very seriously. If you have any concerns regarding 
the security aspects of the source code or any other resource in this repo, 
or have uncovered a security vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to 
report that to our private and highly confidential security mailing list: 
security@wso2.com first, without disclosing them in any forums, sites or 
other groups - public or private. 

We will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and disclosure of 
the vulnerability, if reported issue is identified as a true positive. To 
protect the end-user security, these issues could be disclosed in other 
places only after WSO2 completes itâ€™s mitigation actions and disclosure 
process.

Warning : Please do not create GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

WSO2 guidelines for reporting a security vulnerability page describes how 
to report a Security Vulnerability and includes a public key if you wish 
to send secure messages to security@wso2.com
